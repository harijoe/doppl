        # PHP, the language of web

        According to the last w3techs study, <strong>PHP is the most used language</strong> for website development.
        The big names on the web such as Facebook or Amazon use it extensively for their operations. Wordpress, the most used
        <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> is actually coded in PHP. A large amount of developers know PHP, it
        is thus easier to recruit new developers as the project grows.

        # Choosing Javascript for your project
        Javascript's popularity has steadily increased in the last years. Especially with the release of Angular in 2009 and
        the growing hype around <abbr title="Single-page Applications">SPA</abbr>. The <strong>ReactJS</strong> technology is now the industry
        standard for frontend Javascript. But Javascript can also be used on the server side, with help of NodeJs.

        # React, leader of frontend Javascript frameworks
        User interfaces developed in Javascript became more complex. This resulted in the creation of <strong>ReactJS</strong>,
        a javascript library which encourage developers to think in terms of components, instead of globally. This is nowadays
        the <strong>industry standard</strong> for complex web applications development. We can even use it for mobile app
        development thanks to <strong>React Native</strong>

        With the release of NodeJS, it has been possible these last years to develop applications <strong>backends in javascript</strong>*[]:
        This has the advantage of using the same language for the whole technology stack. It is possible to use it with new
        technologies such as Server-Side Rendering, which allows to use ReactJS and to keep the app SEO-friendly as it would
        be with a regular website.

        For years, deploying into production was the scariest step in a product lifecycle development. The goal of the DevOps
        culture is to make deployments to production as easy as pushing a button. The users won't even notice they now browse
        an updated version of the app!

        # Develop with Symfony
        PHP is an excellent language to quickly develop a Proof Of Concept. The language offers tools to interact the HTTP
        protocol in a handy way natively. No need to reinvent the wheel or to install heavy libraries as it would be the case
        with Java for example.
        In addition, it is possible, using a framework such as Symfony, to develop maintainable and well-organised code
        which will be easy to expand as your project grows.
